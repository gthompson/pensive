# Pensive

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/usgs/pensive.png)](https://travis-ci.org/usgs/pensive)

A Java application designed to allow visualizing, in near real-time, spectral content of continuous seismic waveforms from a number of sensors deployed on active volcanoes. The application was designed with ease of use in mind. Pensive strives to use sensible defaults in all areas while proving an expressive configuration file to permit fine-grained control when needed.

## Requirements
  * A Java runtime. Tested with Java virtual machines from [Oracle](https://www.java.com/en/) and [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/). Any JVM that supports Java 7 or later should do the trick.
  * Source of wave data. Pensive can request data using either the Winston wave server protocol or the Earthworm WaveServerV protocol.
  * A Web browser. Tested with recent versions of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), and [Internet Exporer](https://windows.microsoft.com/ie).
  
## Instalation
Pensive is distributed as an uber-jar containing both the pensive application and its required libraries. No further installation is required.

## Configuration
Pensive looks for its configuration in a file called pensive.config in the current working directory. Optionally, a different filename may be provided as the last argument on the command line when launching Pensive. An example config can be generated by launching Pensive with the `-c` flag as shown below. 

    java -jar pensive.jar -c

## Starting Pensive
Pensive can be run in either real-time or back-fill modes. 

### Starting Pensive in real-time mode
In real-time mode Pensive will create a continuous series of plots. Every ten minutes Pensive will wake up to create plots which cover the previous time span and then go to sleep. This will continue until the program is exited. Start Pensive in real-time mode with a command similar to the one below.

    java -jar pensive.jar
    
### Starting Pensive in back-fill mode
In back-fill mode, Pensive will create a series of plots for a given timespan then exit. Pensive will re-create any existing plots within the given timespan. Pensive can be started in back-fill mode with a command similar to the one below. Times are provided in yyyyMMddHHmm format.
